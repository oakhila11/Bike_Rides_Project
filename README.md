# Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success? </br> (Capstone project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate)
## Table of Contents
## Summary
## Introduction
This case study is a part of my Google Data Analytics Certification. I work with an imaginary comapny called Cyclistic for this project. With training concentrated on essential analytical abilities (data cleansing, analysis, and visualisation) and technologies (R Programming, Tableau), the programme equips learners for a career in data analytics. I used the 6 basic steps (ASK, PREPARE,PROCESS,ANALYSE,SHARE,ACT) to complete this capstone project.
#### Scenario
In this scenario, I are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. This is why, the team wants to understand how the member and the casual riders of the company use their bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. </br>

#### About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

## ASK (Guiding Question)
The designated business task is to look into any usage discrepancies between annual members and casual riders in the bike share data. The Cyclistic marketing team will be informed of the insights obtained. The marketing director wants to increase the number of yearly subscriptions by creating focused advertising efforts to turn casual riders into yearly members. </br>
Essentially, we have to identify the behavior of the annual members and the casual riders and highlight the difference between their usage.

# Case Study 1: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success? 
#### (Capstone project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate)

## Purpose
I have access to a public dataset made available by a fictitious company called Cyclistic as part of this study. Here, I'm using the programming language R to manipulate and clean the data. Tableau is the tool I use to visualise data. The Data Analysis process (ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS ANALYSE SHARE, ACT) learnt through my certification is used in this case study.
